 *
 * <p>"The Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI) was defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 2005
 * as a new internet standard to extend upon the existing Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme.[1] The new standard
 * was published in RFC 3987."</p>
 *
 * <p>"While URIs are limited to a subset of the ASCII character set, IRIs may contain characters from the Universal
 * Character Set (Unicode/ISO 10646), including Chinese or Japanese kanji, Korean, Cyrillic characters, and so
 * forth."</p>
 *
 * <p>"Internationalized Resource Identifiers, or IRIs, are unique identifiers which could also be resolvable. Because
 * resolving is not a requirement, IRIs/URIs are used instead of IRLs/URLs. In order to allow the greatest flexibility
 * in the characters used in an identifier, IRIs are used instead of URIs as IRIs can contain some characters outside of
 * the ASCII character set."</p>
